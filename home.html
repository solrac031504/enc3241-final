<h4>Introduction to Semiconductors and the SSC</h4>
<p>This website hopes to describe the intricate world of semiconductors and their supply chain, emphasizing the critical role they play in modern hardware. The exploration begins with an overview of semiconductors, their fundamental properties, and their widespread applications in various technologies. The semiconductor supply chain's complexity is explained through its several integral parts, including research and development (R&D);  design; fabrication; and assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP).</p>

<p>The website goes beyond the technical aspects, shedding light on the importance of semiconductors in the global market. It explores issues of monopoly and duopoly by examining key players like TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and ASML. The analysis extends to the broader market, discussing potential challenges and drawing parallels between semiconductors and the oil industry.</p>

<h4>What Are Semiconductors?</h4>

<p>The word &ldquo;<a href="glossary.html#Semiconductor">semiconductor</a>&rdquo; is a term that many have heard, yet it is rarely elaborated on. A semiconductor is the base component for all computers. They are used in every piece of equipment that processes information, and they are in every individual component of a computer. The smallest individual semiconductor piece is called a <a href="glossary.html#Transistor">transistor</a>. A transistor is a circuit that either stops or passes current, which creates true or false values that can perform any type of computation. While their function has not changed since the first solid state transistor were created in the 1940s, technological advancement has been focused on the number of transistors that can be used at once. The number of transistors is called the amount of &ldquo;computing power&rdquo; you have. Technological progress has been centered on fitting as many transistors on a single component, or a chip, forcing the transistors to be smaller and smaller in order to have access to more compute. Current technology is at the &ldquo;3 nanometer (nm)&rdquo; scale, where a single transistor can be the size of 40 nm, or 40 billionths of a meter. For reference, a single human hair is anywhere from 50,000 nm to 100,000 nm. </p>

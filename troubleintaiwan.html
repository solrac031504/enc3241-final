<h4>Trouble in Taiwan</h4>
<br>

<p>
<p class="leftpquote">"It was this economic support that built  TMSC and Taiwan to be the leading producer in semiconductors...."</p>


The largest point of failure that has been in focus is Taiwan, a self governing island nation that sits in the Pacific Ocean only 100 miles from China. It is the host nation of TSMC, which comprises 15% of the nation&apos;s GDP [6]. Taiwan is the result of a defeated nationalist state that lost against the communist People&apos;s Republic of China. The two nations are still in a cold war with China threatening to invade and occupy the territory.  Although after the ceasefire, the U.S. heavily supported Taiwan to become a developed export-oriented democracy, supplying the nation with military and economic support. It was this economic support that built  TMSC and Taiwan to be the leading producer in semiconductors. 
<br><br>
While The United States and its allies have no formal diplomatic relation with Taiwan, they have economic partnerships that assist with trade. This allows these countries to keep their One China Policy positions while still contributing large amounts of money to their economies. 
<br><br>
It has been causing a lot of concern that one of the most important places for chip production is in the middle of a cold war, with the possibility of going hot at any time. The industry is what is keeping the island safe, Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen called it a &ldquo;silicon shield&ldquo; protecting the country[12]. This is because of a nuclear-like mutually assured destruction between the island and the rest of the world depending on its chips. Losing 37% of the global semiconductor market located on the island would cause economic implications on par to the COVID pandemic [13].
<br><br>
The other bottleneck and potential source of collapse in the system is with SME produced by ASML. While The Netherlands are in a very safe and peaceful climate compared to Taiwan, they are still concentrating all of their eggs in one basket by having all of the assembly of EUV lithography devices in one plant in the small town of Veldhoven. Any interruption to that plant would stop the supply chain. Before they cracked EUV, ASML bought up the failing lithography manufacturer in the United States in 2001. Three senators wrote to President George W. Busch saying &ldquo;ASML will wind up with all of the U.S. government&apos;s EUV technology.&ldquo; [13] What they worried about came true. At the time most industry leaders thought that the price of the monopoly was worth the new technology they would get out of it. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, the SSC needs itself in order to sustain. All of the SME needed is extremely computationally intensive. If any large event were to take place, like a military invasion or a natural disaster (Taiwan often gets barraged with multiple typhoons a season, along with its military threat) it would lead to one of these critical pieces of infrastructure to be destroyed. In order to fix it it would take an almost insurmountable amount of computing equipment to build more fabs in a short enough time frame. This is a particularly difficult challenge in a world that has been heavily disrupted already by the SSC faltering. We have built an extremely complicated web of irreplaceable technology, all depending on a few actors across the world to be kept running. 
<br><br>
Companies fail all the time. The market is able to correct for that because there are other firms who can step up their production to meet the consumer&apos;s needs. This is different because it would be no easy task to shore up all of the investment that the current companies have put to the table. All of their foundries were developed years in advance and required an elite set of engineers devoting their lives to the industry in order to make new developments. Normally if a specialized product cannot be produced, people would just consume less of it, but this is no longer possible. We have built up an infrastructure reliant on digital systems, and productivity on every structure relies on computation. Furthermore, most chips have a shelf life, and need to be replaced after about 5 years [14]. The computers that fail would not be able to be easily replaced. Projects expecting to be completed may have to be put on hold, causing a cascading economic effect. Any disruptions to the supply chain that result in a decrease in our computational power would cause a much larger dent in the health of the economy because we are set up to expect continuous rollout of better and better devices.

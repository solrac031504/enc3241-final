<h4>ASML</h4>

<p>Fabrication is not the smallest bottleneck to semiconductor production. Fabs cost tens of billions of dollars because of the extremely advanced photolithography equipment that has to be purchased from other companies. There is only one firm that can provide the Extreme Ultraviolet <a href="glossary.html#Photolithography">photolithography</a>, which is the only way that fabs like <a href="glossary.html#TSMC">TSMC</a> and Samsung can etch their complex, nanometer-scale designs. Each of these machines are about the size of a bus and cost as much as $180 million each. Despite their vast importance, only 55 of them are assembled each year, and just over 100 are in use today <a href="workscited.html#source9">[9]</a>. 
<br>
This was no small feat of the company, its competitors, Japanese-based Cannon and Nikon, believed EUV lithography to be unattainable and focused their efforts on maximizing the subpar Deep Ultraviolet Lithography, based on lower wavelengths. These companies thought <a href="glossary.html#MooresLaw">Moore&apos;s Law</a> would end, and <a href="glossary.html#ASML">ASML</a> is the sole reason why we are able to maintain pace. ASML focused 17 years and billions of dollars in R&D in order to create what the other firms deemed out of reach. The firm is expected to maintain its footing, using its profits to charge ahead to the next iteration of their design, consisting of large equipment to make even smaller etches. This would allow fabs to increase production by fitting even more transistors per square inch of silicon. To enter the EUV lithography market and try to give ASML a competition, it would have to take extensive measures along the lines of these steps below. 

 <ol type="1">
  <li>Perform initial research on the issue and look into what they are going to develop in coming years.</li>
<br>
  <li>Commission the government for subsidies and grants in return for the industry that the company brings to the region.</li>
<br>
  <li>Contract and make billion dollar deals with production contractors like Applied Materials and Lam Research to obtain testing equipment and raw materials.</li>

  <li>Develop the prototype incrementally over years, spending large suns of capital with each revision.</li>
<br>
  <li>Broker deals with foundries showing proof of functioning </li>
<br>
  <li>Distribute massive equipment overseas to the foundries purchasing the new product.</li>
 </ol> 

Walking into Best Buy gives the buyer the illusion of a healthy competitive market in the computer industry. Walking across the phone and computer aisles gives name to dozens of brands and even more models. The average consumer doesn&apos;t know that it is all in the hands of a few fabrication companies who are all relying on ASML to produce the necessary equipment coming from a single factory.</p>

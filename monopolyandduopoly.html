<h4>Monopoly and Duopoly in the SSC</h4>
<br>


This industry is dominated by behemoths that take advantage of economies of scale in order to create the leading edge devices at the highest quantities possible. A fabrication site can cost upwards of $10 billion in upfront investment, with the most recent fabrication plant in Arizona having an estimated cost of $40 billion [5]. These investments force companies to focus on specific stages in the manufacturing process. By doing so, they consume larger and larger fractions of the market until there are few left competing with each other.  This is especially true in two stages of the supply chain: fabrication and the semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME). This market dynamic leaves the entire world industry resting on stilts supported on only one or two firms, concentrated in few locations around the world.

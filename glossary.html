<h4>Glossary</h4>

<ul>
	<li><b><a id="Semiconductor">Semiconductor</a></b> - an essential piece of technology that consists of transistors which can pass currents in order to perform computations. Semiconductors are the base component for all computers, and they are used in every piece of equipment that processes information.</li>
	<li><b><a id="Transistor">Transistor</a></b> - a small circuit that stops or passes current between terminals. </li>
	<li><b><a id="SSC">Semiconductor Supply Chain (SSC)</a></b> - SSC is the means of manufacturing, production, and distribution for semiconductors. It involves many countries and many links which work together to create semiconductors.</li>
	<li><b><a id="IP">Intellectual Property (IP)</a></b> - a work or invention which was created by human creativity and can be patented, copyrighted, or trademarked. </li>
	<li><b><a id="DepositionTools">Deposition tools</a></b> - tools used to place or create a new layer onto the structure. </li>
	<li><b><a id="Photolithography">Photolithography</a></b> - a process which transfers patterns from a photomask to where the semiconductor device is attached. </li>
	<li><b><a id="Photomask">Photomask</a></b> - a transparent plate with a circuit pattern [2]. </li>
	<li><b><a id="EtchingTools">Etching tools</a></b> - tools that remove materials from a thin film on the surface where the semiconductor device is attached in order to create a pattern. </li>
	<li><b><a id="IOT">Internet of Things (IoT)</a></b> - &ldquo;a network of interrelated devices that connect and exchange data with other IoT devices and the cloud&rdquo; [10]. </li>
	<li><b><a id="TSMC">TSMC</a></b> - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. A company that makes up 15% of Taiwan&apos;s economic output. The company is in the contract fabrication business responsible for producing the integrated circuits for processors around the world. They are responsible for 37% of the semiconductors produced in the world.</li>
	<li><b><a id="ASML">ASML</a></b> - formerly Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography. The Dutch multinational corporation that is the sole developer of EUV photolithography which is the key SME needed by firms such as Samnsung and TSMC. </li>
	<li><b><a id="OneChinaPolicy">One China Policy</a></b> - the diplomatic position that there is only one Chinese government. The United States and other countries recognize the nation of Taiwan, but remain ambiguous to Beijing's right to control the island nation. This policy demotes the official title of Taiwan to a &ldquo;Special Administrative Region&rdquo;. </li>
	<li><b><a id="GDP">GDP</a></b> - Gross Domestic Product. It is the total market value of all of the finished goods and services produced inside of a country's borders over a specific time period. </li>
	<li><b><a id="MooresLaw">Moore&apos;s Law</a></b> - the prediction made by Gordon Moore in 1965 that has defined the exponential growth of the semiconductor industry. The official theory states the that number of transistors that can fit on a single microchip doubles every two years. Over time, this law has remained largely true. Over recent history, experts assumed that the law would end after certain points and have regularly been proving wrong. The rule has slowed somewhat since 2010, semiconductor growth has still followed an exponential growth rate. </li>
	<li><b><a id="VerticalIntegration">Vertical Integration</a></b> - a business strategy where the business itself controls the supply chain and multiple stages of its production process. </li>
	<li><b><a id="HorizontalIntegration">Horizontal Integration</a></b> - a growth strategy where a business takes over another company that operates at the same value chain level. </li>
